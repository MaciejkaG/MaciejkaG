# About me
**I'm Maciej, a creative technologist and fullstack developer for the most part.**<br>
<sup>*But I constantly learn and adapt, and did DevOps, 3D modelling, video editing, game development, mobile development and a bit of electronics too.*</sup>

Speaking: Polish (native), English (fluent)<br>

## My toolset
I started my journey with **Python**. Once I felt I’d squeezed enough out of it, I moved on to **JavaScript**, which remains my main language until today. Recently I’ve been going deep into Rust and I plan to stick with it long-term. Along the way I also worked with PHP and a bit of C++ for school and side projects — neither really clicked with me.

On the frontend side, I began with **jQuery**, then quickly moved on to modern frameworks. I have the most experience with **Next.js**, and more recently I’ve been enjoying **SvelteKit** a lot. For backend work I’ve used **Express** and sometimes **Flask**.<br>
For desktop apps I started with **Electron**, but nowadays I use **Tauri** — it has its flaws, but overall it’s a much better tradeoff.

For design and planning I use **Figma** extensively, and **Notion** (sometimes **Trello**) for organising projects, ideas and collaboration.

I’m comfortable across all major desktop OSes. I daily-drive **Linux** (Ubuntu),  **macOS** and **Windows**. I’ve hopped through a fair share of distros over the years and found Ubuntu to be the one. I haven’t shipped large mobile apps yet, but I know the internals and ecosystems of both **Android** and **iOS** well enough.

# Major things I'm working on:

## [Hana](https://hanassh.com/) (In Development)
An SSH client, working on every platform in perfect sync and harmony. I want to provide modern features, customisation, a pretty UI and transparency. I'm currently working on Hana Desktop which will run on all major platforms. It will be open-source and among others feature E2EE cross-platform cloud sync (with an option to self-host the server instead) and collaboration.

## [Starpaste](https://starpaste.eu/) (Closed Alpha)
The ultimate end-to-end encrypted collaborative workspace built for everyone, but with developers and power-users in mind. Currently in closed alpha, open beta is the next stage and it's yet to be announced. Starting 1.0 will be open-sourced.

# Less major things I've been working on:

## [The Squircle Portal](https://squircle.site/)
A WIP all-in-one website for the squircle nerds. Open-sourced [here](https://github.com/MaciejkaG/the-squircle-portal/).

## [Apollo](https://github.com/77-co/Apollo/)
An experimental IoT AI-based voice assistant. It uses various APIs to provide seamless experience, sealed with a wonderful design. Apollo integrates with your favorite everyday services like Google Calendar and Spotify and supports your most intelligent models from Anthropic, OpenAI and Google.

## [1sh.pl](https://1sh.pl/)
A simple URL shortener I made in less then 2 hours. More features (like custom links, tracking) are planned. Open-sourced [here](https://github.com/MaciejkaG/1sh).

Got much more planned though! I'm also constantly working with my friend under our [seventy7](https://github.com/77-co) brand to deliver even more impressive projects.
