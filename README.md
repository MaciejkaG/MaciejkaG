# Current projects:

## Project O / Lux
I'm currently working on an MMO desktop game in Godot and a non-intrusive launcher in Electron for it (and possible future games) that would both utilise **mcjk id** for authentication. Further details to be shared later.

## [mcjk id](https://id.mcjk.cc/)
A proprietary authentication service based on Auth0, designed to work with games and social apps of mine.

## [Statki](https://statki.mcjk.cc/)
Statki is an online battleships game built using Socket.io with Express and vanilla JS.

## [Apollo](https://github.com/77-co/Apollo/)
An experimental IoT AI-based voice assistant. It uses Google's and OpenAI's APIs to provide seamless experience, sealed with a wonderful design. Apollo integrates with your favorite everyday services like Google Calendar and Spotify.

## [buzz](https://github.com/MaciejkaG/buzz/)
Buzz is an open-source web-based buzzer system built in Next.js. This way you could easily organise a classroom quiz game, or a family game night, or maybe a fun activity for you and your colleagues!
